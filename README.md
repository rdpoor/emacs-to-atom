# emacs-to-atom
A recovering emacs user's journal

## Introduction
I started using emacs multiple decades ago back when it was the programmer's choice for BSD-based Unix systems.  (And no, we will not discuss vi here...)  I internalized all the finger-macros and could get around large bodies of code quickly.  I embraced the powerful packages it had to offer like tags searching, dynamic completion and (of course) keyboard macros.

But now it's 2018 and I've decided to try out Atom, the new open-source upstart.  Atom runs on multiple platforms, it's beautifully integrated with github.  It's fast, it's pretty, it has lots of packages to do lots of things.

So I've given myself at least a full month of abstinence from emacs in order to give Atom a fair shake.  Atom still feels alien to me in many ways -- my fingers still twitch for \[meta\]-/ -- but I'm committed to sticking with it.

For the time being, I'm using this page as a place to make note of the things I liked in emacs that I miss in Atom.  Or perhaps more accurately, the things I liked in emacs for which I don't yet know how to do in Atom.

## I wish I could...

This is an unordered list of things that I can easily do in emacs that I don't yet know how to do in Atom.  Each headline is a link to an Issue entry, so the Atom community is welcome to add comment there.

### Sort lines of text alphabetically

In emacs, `\[meta\]-x sort-region` sorts a block of lines aphabetically.  In retrospect, I'm surprised how often I use it.

### Tab to re-indent according to mode

If you've messed up the indentation of a function, 

### Have something like `\[meta\]-space` for 'just one space'

Who would think such a simple command would be so useful.  just-one-space deletes all spaces and tabs around point, leaving one space.
